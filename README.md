## Hi, I'm Joe!  

I'm a Software Engineer & AI Integration Specialist with 14 years of experience architecting scalable systems and intelligent automation pipelines. I work extensively with Python backend development, React/Vue.js/Next.js frontends, RESTful / GraphQL APIs, and integrating LLM capabilities into production applications.
My focus is on building robust, API-driven architectures that seamlessly connect traditional software systems with modern AI technologies to solve complex engineering challenges.
